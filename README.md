# 1-dim-SDE-Ontogenetic-Growth
The project develops a 1-dimensional stochastic model to capture ontogenetic growth patterns across 13 animal species, using 206 data points. It fits the data to the model to derive stochastic curves for each species and aims to create a universal growth curve applicable to all species.
